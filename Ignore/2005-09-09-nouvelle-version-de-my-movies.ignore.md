Vous vous rappelez sans doute du fameux programme qui me permettait de faire ma liste de divx et d'afficher ça sous Media Center. Il est de retour dans sa version 1.5 (My Movies 1.5) ! Et avec elle plein de nouveautés dont voici la liste :
			<ul>
				<li>Interface improvements to match Media Center 2005 Update Rollup 2 (Emerald) that will be released soon (I hope). Notice that the rollup is not required running "My Movies".</li>
				<li>Data loading has been pretty much re-done, and is now plug-in based - additional data providers can be added to "My Movies" simply by dropping a dll file. Hopefully developers find this interesting - full source code example on how to create such plug-ins will be available on the website soon.</li>
				<li>If "My Movies" is added to the start page menu, the three last watched movies will now appear in the start menu next to the link, in the same way as "My Music", "My Pictures" and other Media Center features does.</li>
				<li>TheaterTek implementation has been improved, and is prepared for TheaterTek 2.2 when this will be released. Generally this new implementation should make the TheaterTek implementation more stable. On the website in the "Documents" section there is also a guide on how to install and setup TheaterTek and "My Movies" for this implementation to work best possible.</li>
				<li>The software now has a "Filters" functionality which I personally see as a great feature above anything else. Now you can create a filter that filters on watched status, online status, MPAA ratings, genres, production year, runtime and star rating, giving you the option to create a filter and recall its contents again and again.</li>
				<li>You can now copy a DVD to your hard drive from within Media Center using "My Movies", and you can add the title to your collection at the same time. Currently DVD copying can be a 1:1 copy only in VIDEO_TS file format. Notice that "My Movies" will not copy CSS copy protected discs - in countries where removing the copy protection is legal, you can use a tool such as AnyDVD that will make all DVD's unencrypted for other software such as "My Movies" - only copy DVD's that you own, remember that piracy is stealing.</li>
				<li>Some collection management can now be done directly from "Media Center"; you can add an offline title (a title stored on a DVD disc) from the Media Center interface, and you can add an online title by adding it while copying in a DVD. For now, you still need to use the "Edit collection" program to add existing online titles though.</li><li>You can now add and remove "My Movies" to and from the start page menu from "Settings", "User interface", so that you do not have to uninstall and install if you forget to check the box in the installer.</li>
				<li>A new cast list has been created in the "Cast and More" section, so that you can now see the director, and the role each actor plays.</li>
				<li>From "Settings", "User interface" you can now configure the program to be optimized for mouse or touch screen use which has previously been a problem for some.</li>
				<li>Spanish is now on the list of available languages.</li>
			</ul>
<br />
Besides these new features, a lot of other small things has been improved and fixed.
