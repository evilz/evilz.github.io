title: 2.0.1 point release
---

We've just pushed 2.0.1 to nuget, it's a small release mostly with bug fixes missing from 2.0.0.

# What's New?

- Resolved compilation errors in the Caliburn.Micro.Start package due to the breaking changes in 2.0.0.
- `PropertyChangedBase` supports DataContract serialization on appropriate platforms.
- Windows Phone 8.1 now exposes an `INavigationService.BackPressed` to better let apps handle and potentially cancel hardware back button events.
- Added a convention for Windows Phone 8.1 `Pivot`.
- Resolved a bug where `OnViewReady` argument was null.
- `ActionMessage` is more resilient to null values.
- Resolved BindingScope.FindNamedDescendants crashed on DependencyObjects
- Added `View.IsInDesignMode`.

Thanks to all who contributed fixes, logged bugs etc.
