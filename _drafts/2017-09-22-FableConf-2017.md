#### Fable for busy dads: how Fable helps me to spend more time with my children

avec 3 kids, hard to find time for kids
always thinking of work

2000 before child dev video game => work a lot 
then kid 2007 -> 2010 -> big video game multi player -> work a lot
2010 => third kids -> bye great job -> one year off for familly and friends
2011 => entrepreneur in indie video game => ran out of money
2015 => consulting 
Today => 70% project in JS   in Haxe then scala (too hard to read but interesting for function)
AND THEN F# and Fable

F# => esy to learn, very functionnal, expressif so easy to read now and later.  Easy to reafactor and 
Crossplatform

Tools is fast to install
templates exist thank to suave-fable-scaffolding
ionide 
TS2Fable => 90% of the job
fulma

10 months later => 3 games in pixijs

dev faster => YES
dev safer => Yes
less bug
